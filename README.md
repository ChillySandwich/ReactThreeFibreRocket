# ReactThreeFibreRocket

First basic project working with React Three Fiber. 

3d rendering of a model + event handling to dynamically change color.

I modelled a basic rocket in Blender, and exported it as a GLTF object.

Great to use some tools by the Poimandres team:
-react-three-fiber
-drei
-valtio state management
-GLTFJSX converter
